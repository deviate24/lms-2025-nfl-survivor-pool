                    <p>
                        The NFL Survivor Pool is a season-long competition where participants pick one NFL team each week to win. 
                        The key twist: <strong>you can only use each team once during the entire season</strong>.

                    <h2 class="h4">How to Play</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Each week, select one NFL team you believe will win their game.</li>
                        <li>If your selected team wins, you "survive" and continue to the next week.</li>
                        <li>If your selected team loses or ties, you're eliminated from the pool.</li>
                        <li>You cannot pick the same team twice in a season.</li>
                        <li>All picks must be submitted before the weekly deadline (typically Thursday at 4:00 PM PT for the first game of the week).</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-4">
                    <h2 class="h4">Special Weeks</h2>
                    <p>Some weeks may be designated as "Double-Pick" weeks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You must select two different teams to win.</li>
                        <li><strong>You need both picks to be correct to automatically advance.</strong></li>
                        <li>If no entries pick both teams correctly, then entries with one correct pick will advance.</li>
                        <li>If multiple entries have the same number of correct picks (1 out of 2), they all advance to the next week.</li>
                        <li>If both of your picks lose or tie, you're eliminated regardless of how others performed.</li>
                        <li>Remember, you still can't reuse any teams from previous weeks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-4">
                    <h2 class="h4">Winning the Pool</h2>
                    <p>
                        The last participant(s) standing wins the pool. If multiple participants survive until the end of the regular season, the prize will be split equally among them.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-4">
                    <h2 class="h4">Tiebreakers</h2>
                    <p>If all remaining participants are eliminated in the same week:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The participant who correctly picked the most weeks overall wins.</li>
                        <li>If still tied, the prize is split equally.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-4">
                    <h2 class="h4">Deadlines</h2>
                    <p>
                        All picks must be submitted before the weekly deadline. The deadline is typically set to Thursday at 4:00 PM PT, or 10 minutes before the first game of the week (whichever comes first).
                    </p>
                    <div class="alert alert-warning">

                        <strong>Important:</strong> Missing a deadline counts as an elimination. No exceptions will be made for late picks.

                    <h2 class="h4">Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>
                        To maintain fairness, current week picks are hidden from other participants until the weekly deadline passes. This prevents players from gaining an advantage by seeing others' selections.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h2 class="h4">Pool Entries</h2>
                    <p>
                        Participants may have multiple entries in the pool. Each entry:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Must make independent picks</li>
                        <li>Is tracked separately for elimination</li>
                        <li>Requires separate entry fees</li>
                    </ul>
